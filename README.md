# Visual-chest-belt
* This project is build an guiding system to support people with visual impairment.
  
* Using realsense camera and open-source pretreined Mrcnn model to detect the object and estimate the distance from the camera to the objects.
  
* You can use YOLO model to improve the FPS of the frame.

* Use some techniques in image processing to control the frame, develop a boundary to block all unwanted infomation from the frame.
  
* Convert the Guiding information to voice to guide user.

* Apply Pretrained model Mask Rcnn to detect object and use realsense camera to estimate the distance to object
